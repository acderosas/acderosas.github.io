# Andre de Rosas' React (Next.JS) Website hosted thru GitHub

Notes:
* Using react-pageflip: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pageflip
* Influenced by rohinai's CodeSandbox code on pageflip logic: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/book-pjug9?file=%2Fpackage.json
* Using this for fire: https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/gKRKKb
* Wanted to then structure html, css, and js in framework to have components so will use Next JS. Will learn about React and Next JS along the way..
* Use npm run dev to go into dev mode to see live updates instead of liveserver
* Will need yml for Next.js
* Favicon is too small need more simplistic design, probably just not use
* Neocities influence in terms of navigating off a setting
